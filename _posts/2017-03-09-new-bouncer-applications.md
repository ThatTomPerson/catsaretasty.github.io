title: 'Tastycat 2017 Bouncer Application'
---
We have just started with out new bouncer application, this will run for a while or until we have more than enough entries.

Keep in mind that by applying, you're not guaranteeing your position as a staff member, and your presence and behaviour on the community is still the key for being a good applicant.

You can fill in your own application by clicking the button on our [homepage](https://tastycat.org/) or by going directly to our [Typeform](https://tastycat.typeform.com/to/n7Llfz).

Please keep in mind we will be reviewing your application in the following weeks, so *DO NOT* ask for results until then.

Pay attention to Discord and/or your Email, because that is how we plan to contact you, if needed.

<strong>You have until 23rd of March to fill in your application.</strong>
